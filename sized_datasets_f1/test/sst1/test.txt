1	it does nt do the original any particular dishonor but neither does it exude any charm or personality 
0	fear dot com is so rambling and disconnected it never builds any suspense 
2	a gorgeous somnolent show that is splendidly mummified and thoroughly unsurprising 
0	it feels like a community theater production of a great broadway play even at its best it will never hold a candle to the original 
2	the film apparently takes place in a fantasy world where people in hotel hallways recite poetry in voice over instead of speaking to each other 
2	the element of surprise might be the only thing femme fatale has going for it 
1	it is the kind of movie you ca nt quite recommend because it is all windup and not much of a pitch yet you ca nt bring yourself to dislike it 
1	maybe it is asking too much but if a movie is truly going to inspire me i want a little more than this 
1	a graceless witless attempt at mating some like it hot with the wwii espionage thriller 
1	the story and characters are nowhere near gripping enough 
1	based on a david leavitt story the film shares that writer is usual blend of observant cleverness too facile coincidence and slightly noxious preciousness

0	national lampoon is van wilder could be the worst thing to come out of national lampoon since class reunion
1	this is a great subject for a movie but hollywood has squandered the opportunity using it as a prop for warmed over melodrama and the kind of choreographed mayhem that director john woo has built his career on 
0	ecks this one off your must see list 
1	overall the film misses the brilliance of jelinek is novel by some way

2	not a cheap slasher flick as the subject matter would suggest but is a little like a nature film showing a patient predator and his foolish prey 
1	uneasy mishmash of styles and genres 
1	herzog is obviously looking for a moral to his fable but the notion that a strong unified showing among germany and eastern european jews might have changed th century history is undermined by ahola is inadequate performance

0	i wish i could say thank god it is friday but the truth of the matter is i was glad when it was over 
1	nothing about it fits 
1	as it abruptly crosscuts among the five friends it fails to lend the characters individual stories enough dramatic resonance to make us care about them 
1	somehow we re meant to buy that this doting mother would shun her kids travel to one of the most dangerous parts of the world don fatigues and become g i jane 
1	the cast is so low wattage that none of the characters comes off as big and the setting remains indistinct

1	the movie quickly drags on becoming boring and predictable 
1	i tried to read the time on my watch 
0	the film makes a tragic error by going on for too long trying to mirror every subsequent event in chinese history war revolution communism etc 
2	johnson has in his first film set himself a task he is not nearly up to 
1	ultimately the project comes across as clinical detached uninvolving possibly prompting audience members to wonder what is the point 
1	the two leads are almost good enough to camouflage the dopey plot but so much naturalistic small talk delivered in almost muffled exchanges eventually has a lulling effect 
1	the film meant well in its horse tale about freedom but was nt able to reach the heart because it was too overbearing 
0	the movie is as far as you can get from racy to the point where it almost stops the blood flow to your brain it has a dull costumey feel 
1	once the audience figure out what is being said the filmmaker is relative passivity will make it tough for them to really care 
1	there is nothing provocative about this film save for the ways in which it studiously avoids provoking thought 
2	it seems just a long convoluted ploy to get men into drag period drag no less 
1	the premise for this kegger comedy probably sounded brilliant four six packs and a pitcher of margaritas in but the film must have been written in the thrall of a vicious hangover

1	the film equivalent of a toy chest whose contents get scattered over the course of minutes 
1	just a bloody mess 
1	creepy but ultimately unsatisfying thriller 
1	you would be better off investing in the worthy emi recording that serves as the soundtrack or the home video of the malfitano domingo production

1	bears is bad 
1	not terrible filmmaking bad but more like i once had a nightmare like this and it is now coming true bad 
2	as is most commonly case with projects such noble and lofty ambitions the film is less poetic than simply pretentious 
1	george hire a real director and good writers for the next installment please 
1	for a film about two mismatched buddies crystal and de niro share little screen time and even less chemistry 
2	however clever nelson has been in providing variation within the confines of her structure and staging the question remains whether this should indeed have been presented as a theatrical release

1	human nature talks the talk but it fails to walk the silly walk that distinguishes the merely quirky from the surreal 
3	city by the sea is the cinematic equivalent of defensive driving it is careful conscientious and makes no major mistakes 
1	but what saves lives on the freeway does not necessarily make for persuasive viewing 
2	the marquis de sade could nt have been as dull a person as this film makes him out to be 
1	what could have been a neat little story about believing in yourself is swamped by heavy handed melodrama 
2	the cast is uniformly excellent but the film itself is merely mildly charming 
2	drives for the same kind of bittersweet conciliatory tone that three seasons achieved but loses its way in rhetorical excess and blatant sentimentality 
1	the whole thing plays out with the drowsy heaviness of synchronized swimmer wearing a wool wetsuit 
1	fairly successful at faking some pretty cool stunts but a complete failure at trying to create some pretty cool characters 
1	and forget about any attempt at a plot 
2	it will probably prove interesting to ram dass fans but to others it may feel like a parody of the mellow peace and love side of the s counterculture

1	safe conduct however ambitious and well intentioned fails to hit the entertainment bull is eye 
1	my response to the film is best described as lukewarm 
1	maybe i found the proceedings a little bit too conventional
