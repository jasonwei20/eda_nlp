1	brosnan is finest non bondish performance yet fails to overcome the film is manipulative sentimentality and annoying stereotypes 
3	a film that will be best appreciated by those willing to endure its extremely languorous rhythms waiting for happiness is ultimately thoughtful without having much dramatic impact 
1	to me it sounds like a cruel deception carried out by men of marginal intelligence with reactionary ideas about women and a total lack of empathy 
2	tsai may be ploughing the same furrow once too often 
1	flashy gadgets and whirling fight sequences may look cool but they ca nt distract from the flawed support structure holding equilibrium up 
1	zigzag might have been richer and more observant if it were less densely plotted 
1	how can such a cold movie claim to express warmth and longing 
1	nicks and steinberg match their own creations for pure venality that is giving it the old college try 
1	episode ii attack of the clones is a technological exercise that lacks juice and delight 
1	the problem with all of this it is not really funny 
1	wanders all over the map thematically and stylistically and borrows heavily from lynch jeunet and von trier while failing to find a spark of its own

0	unfortunately one hour photo lives down to its title 
0	thanks largely to williams all the interesting developments are processed in minutes the rest is just an overexposed waste of film 
0	cold sterile and lacking any color or warmth 
1	the film is undone by anachronistic quick edits and occasional jarring glimpses of a modern theater audience watching the events unfold
